Here is the feature breakdown for your three core pillars, designed to position Maghrib.Digital as a high-end "Business-in-a-Box" solution for the MENA region.

1. Service Pillar: High-Performance Web Development
The Pitch: "We don't build websites; we build 24/7 sales engines."
The "Standard" Features (What everyone offers):
Responsive Design: Works on Mobile/Tablet/Desktop.
CMS Setup: Easy content editing (WordPress/Shopify).
Basic SEO: Meta tags and sitemaps.
Contact Forms: Simple lead capture.
The "Maghrib.Digital" Edge (Your Premium Features):
Next.js 16 Architecture: Explain to clients that this means "instant loading" (Server-Side Rendering). Google ranks fast sites higher.
"Dark Mode" Luxury UI: A dedicated switch for Light/Dark mode, designed with your signature neon-noir aesthetic.
Multilingual Native Support (i18n): Built-in support for Arabic (RTL), French, and English without using buggy plugins. The layout automatically flips for Arabic.
Headless CMS Integration: Use Sanity or Strapi so clients have a custom dashboard to update text without breaking the design.
3D Product Interaction: For e-commerce, users can rotate products or see "floating" layers (using Framer Motion) instead of static images.
Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO): Sticky "Buy Now" buttons, exit-intent popups, and automated abandoned cart recovery sequences.
Deliverables to List in Proposals:
"Custom Next.js Frontend," "Headless CMS Dashboard," "Technical SEO Audit," "Speed Index Score > 90," "3-Language Localization."

2. Service Pillar: LLC Creation & Business Infrastructure
The Pitch: "Go Global. We turn your local idea into an International Headquarters." (Targeting MENA entrepreneurs who want to access US/UK banking and payment gateways like Stripe).
The "Standard" Features:
Company Formation: Filing Articles of Organization.
Registered Agent: Providing a US/UK address for legal mail.
EIN Acquisition: Getting the tax ID from the IRS.
The "Maghrib.Digital" Edge:
"Stripe-Ready" Guarantee: Most MENA clients want an LLC specifically to use Stripe/PayPal. Structure the service to ensure their compliance matches Stripe's requirements.
FinTech Banking Setup: Guidance on opening accounts with Mercury, Brex, or Relay (banks friendly to non-US residents) so they can hold USD.
Operating Agreement (Custom): Not a generic template, but one tailored for digital agencies/e-commerce to protect intellectual property.
Virtual Office & Mail Scanning: A real street address (not a PO Box) where you scan and email them their bank cards/letters.
Compliance Dashboard: An automated calendar that alerts them when to file their Annual Report or Franchise Tax so they never get fined.
Deliverables to List in Proposals:
"Delaware/Wyoming LLC Filing," "EIN Tax ID (Express Service)," "US Business Bank Resolution," "Stripe Verification Support," "Digital Operating Agreement."
3. Service Pillar: Strategic Social Media Management
The Pitch: "We don't just post content. We manage your digital reputation."
The "Standard" Features (What everyone offers):
Content Calendar: Planning posts for the month.
Graphic Design: Basic layouts for Instagram/LinkedIn.
Scheduling: Ensuring posts go live on time.
The "Maghrib.Digital" Edge (Your Premium Human Features):
Cultural & Linguistic Nuance: Unlike AI (or foreign agencies), your team deeply understands the "Maghreb Code"—the specific mix of Darija, French, and English that resonates with local buyers. You know exactly when to be formal and when to use humor.
Active Community Management: A real human replies to comments and DMs. This isn't just "customer service"; it's sales. Your team nurtures leads in the DMs until they are ready to buy.
Trend Adaptation, Not Replication: Your team watches the market. When a trend hits Morocco or the GCC, you adapt it creatively to the client's brand voice within 24 hours, rather than just copying a generic template.
Visual Storytelling: We don't just post "single images." We create carousels and reels that tell a cohesive story about the brand's values, team, and mission over weeks.
Crisis Management: If a negative comment or PR issue arises, a human team member alerts the client immediately and drafts a strategic response—something AI cannot do safely.
Deliverables to List in Proposals:
"Dedicated Account Manager," "Bi-Weekly Strategy Calls," "Manual Community Engagement (1hr/day)," "Custom Video Editing (Premiere Pro/CapCut)," "Monthly ROI & Sentiment Report."
