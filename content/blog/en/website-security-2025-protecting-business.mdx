## The Growing Threat Landscape

Cyberattacks are no longer just a concern for large corporations. In 2024, small and medium businesses became the primary target of hackers — and without proper security, your website could be next.

## Essential Security Measures

### 1. SSL/TLS Encryption (HTTPS)

This is non-negotiable. Every website should have an SSL certificate:

- **Encrypts data** between visitors and your server
- **Improves SEO** — Google penalizes non-HTTPS sites
- **Builds trust** — visitors see the padlock icon
- **Free options available** through Let's Encrypt

### 2. Regular Software Updates

Outdated software is the #1 vulnerability:

- Keep your CMS (WordPress, Shopify) updated
- Update all plugins and themes
- Enable automatic updates when possible
- Remove unused plugins and themes

### 3. Strong Password Policies

Weak passwords cause 81% of data breaches:

- Require minimum 12 characters
- Use a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
- Implement two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Use a password manager for your team

### 4. Web Application Firewall (WAF)

A WAF filters malicious traffic before it reaches your site:

- Blocks common attack patterns
- Protection against SQL injection and XSS
- DDoS mitigation
- Services like Cloudflare offer free tiers

## Advanced Security Practices

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

Prevents cross-site scripting attacks by controlling which resources can load on your pages.

### Rate Limiting

Limits requests from single IP addresses to prevent brute force attacks and API abuse.

### Regular Backups

- Automated daily backups
- Store backups off-site
- Test restore procedures regularly

### Security Headers

Implement headers like:
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-Frame-Options
- Strict-Transport-Security

## Monitoring and Response

### Set Up Alerts

- Monitor for downtime
- Track failed login attempts
- Watch for file changes
- Use services like UptimeRobot or Pingdom

### Have an Incident Response Plan

- Know who to contact
- Document steps to take
- Have backup access methods

## The Cost of Ignoring Security

A security breach can cost:

- **Financial losses** — fraud, downtime, recovery
- **Reputation damage** — lost customer trust
- **Legal consequences** — GDPR fines, lawsuits
- **SEO penalties** — Google blacklisting
